/* The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

Note: your function should have a default parameter.

For example(Input --> Output):

"anyone else" --> 0
"Zach" --> 18 */



//  My Solution

function howManyLightsabersDoYouOwn(name) {
    if (name === "Zach"){
      return 18
    }
     else{
       return 0
     }
   }
